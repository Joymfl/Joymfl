### 👋 Hi, I'm Joy

**Tinkerer with a focus on performance and productivity**  
I like building things close to the metal: runtimes, distributed backends, rendering engines, and tools that make other developers faster.

---

### 🧩 What I work on

- ⚙️ **Low-level systems** – runtimes, job systems, schedulers, concurrency primitives  
- 🧬 **Solana & on-chain programs** – parallel execution, account models, safety tooling  
- 🎮 **Rendering & engines** – custom Vulkan-based engine, GPU compute, spatial data structures  
- 🌐 **Backends** – real-time services, distributed workers, observability, infra automation  
- 🖥️ **Developer tools & visualizers** – shader sandboxes, system visualizations, CLIs

### 🚀 Highlighted projects

> I’m progressively open-sourcing more of my work, from my local git server. A few things I’m focusing on:

- **Solana Parallel Execution Simulator**  
  Local simulator that batches transactions based on account overlaps to show how Sealevel parallelizes workloads, with a visual timeline of execution.

- **Vulkan Rendering / Game Engine**  
  Custom engine with a job system, ECS-style architecture, GPU-driven rendering experiments, and plans for SVO / voxel-based navigation and GPU compute.

- **Distributed Job Scheduler**  
  A small but serious distributed worker system: task leasing, retries, priorities, and metrics — designed as a learning playground for building robust backends.

- **Shader & GPU Playground (Web)**  
  Browser-based shader sandbox / WebGPU playground for experimenting with rendering techniques, SDFs, and post-processing pipelines.

(Once these repos are public, I’ll pin them below.)

### 🛠️ Tech I use a lot

- **Languages:** C++, Rust, TypeScript, C, a bit of Python  
- **Systems / Backend:** Linux, Win32,  Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, WebSockets, gRPC, message queues  
- **Blockchain / Solana:** on-chain programs, PDAs, accounts model, runtime behavior  
- **Graphics / Engine:** Vulkan, OpenGL (quick ideation or legacy work), GPGPU, RenderDoc, Text Rendering  
- **Web / Frontend:** React, Vanilla, Tailwind, REST/GraphQL APIs, WebGPU/WebGL  
- **DevEx / Tooling:** CMake, clang-format, CI with GitHub Actions, profiling & tracing tools

---

### 📚 Things I’m actively exploring

- Better models for **parallel runtimes** (job graphs, fibers, work-stealing schedulers)  
- **Solana runtime mechanics** and tools to reason about CU usage and account layouts  
- **GPU compute pipelines** for voxelization, SVOs, Cosserat rods, Game AI and navigation, cross platform ML workflows  
- **Low-latency backends** for multiplayer and real-time systems  
- Clean, **visual developer tooling** for understanding complex systems

---

### 🤝 How I like to work

- I prefer **deep, focused builds** over drive-by demos.  
- I care a lot about **clarity**: architecture docs, diagrams, and in-repo explanations.  
- I like shipping **small, end-to-end vertical slices** that others can run and learn from.
